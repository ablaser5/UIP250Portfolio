Work Sample 1:

This sample was the main project I worked on over the course of this quarter. My task was to convert the back-end of our website to
use a newer version of the python programming language, python 3. This has been a needed project at our company since python 2
(the current version we use) is being phased out of development. For this task, I put together a list of steps that need to be taken in
order to perform these on our production server. To do this, I configured a new Ubuntu (Linux) server on Amazon Web Services with a database
and our existing website code. Then I worked out the necessary steps through research and came up with a complete process that we will run 
on our main server to implement these changes.

Below is the file that is the process I created this quarter:
