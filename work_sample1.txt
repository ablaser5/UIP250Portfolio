Work Sample 1:

This sample was the main project I worked on over the course of this quarter. My task was to convert the back-end of our
website to use a newer version of the python programming language, python 3. This has been a needed project at our company 
since python 2 (the current version we use) is being phased out of development. For this task, I put together a list of steps
that need to be taken in order to perform these on our production server. To do this, I configured a new Ubuntu (Linux) server
on Amazon Web Services with a database and our existing website code. Then I worked out the necessary steps through research
and came up with a complete process that we will run on our main server to implement these changes.

This task relates to my career goals because this is working directly with a linux server as well as the python programming
language. On linux, the correct configuration is required to make the python work, but the python also needs to be modified
to fit the newer version. This task was definitely the hardest and I had many setback such as: errors after converting the
python code to version 3 and invalid packages or libraries that worked in the previous version but do not anymore.

Below is the file that is the process I created this quarter:
