Work Sample 3:

For this assignment, I was tasked with reconfiguring one of our websites that uses wordpress to accept a larger file size for media.
Media can include images, videos, etc. This was hindering our developement because we were unable to put certain content on our website.
To complete this assignment, I had to modify a file called an htaccess file which interacts with the Apache web server to allow or disallow
certain content from being served up by the web server. 

Below is the htaccess file I created to solve this problem:
htaccess.txt
