Work Sample 3:

For this assignment, I was tasked with reconfiguring one of our websites that uses wordpress to accept a larger file size for media.
Media can include images, videos, etc. This was hindering our developement because we were unable to put certain content on our website.
To complete this assignment, I had to modify a file called an htaccess file which interacts with the Apache web server to allow or disallow
certain content from being served up by the web server. 

This task relates back to my career goals because it is working again with a Linux server configuration. This experience
configuring these servers will be very helpful for companies since this is not typically taught in school. With this task, I
had no issues. I was able to complete this project as planned after a little bit of research. 

Below is the htaccess file I created to solve this problem:
